# E-Commerce Cart using Javascript
This is my upgraded version of the e-commerce cart I originally built from a GFG course.  
I’ve added more features, cleaned up the code, and made the cart feel closer to a real app with smoother updates, better state handling, and a more organised structure.  
I’ll keep adding new functionality as I learn, so this repo is basically my little playground for improving frontend skills.  
Note: It is still being improved.
